### What is Heap

Heap is for finding Max / Min value fast. It based complete binary tree by condition where parent and child node have large-small relationship.

### What is Priority Queue

Priority Queue pop data with some priority. For example, when min value is priority, pop min value first, not first in.
It based array or linked list or heap, heap is best(normal).
Heap have large-small relationship, so make this to some priorty we use.
When pushing some data in heap, data is pushed at last position, and replaced by comparing priority.
